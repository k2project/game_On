# Web Developer with balls.

Online portfolio built around break out game. Complete a level to unveil my skills. Give it a go and have a ball!

# Motivation

I intented to build a fun portfolio based on break out game. There are 4 levels of 3 different, randomly generated bricks layouts. The farther you get the harder it gets to complete the level, with super bricks in the final two levels, that need to be hit twice to be distroyed. I used Canvas and React to create the game.
