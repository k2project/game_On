                    <p>I have created this website to introduce myself to you. I'm a front-end webdeveloper and I'm looking for an opportunity to start up my career. </p>
                    <p><b>So why coding?</b> Simply because it's always stimulating! Learning new things constantly and being able to tackle challenges is what I enjoy and what I'm good at.</p>
                    <p><b>Eyes on the ball!</b> My goal is to find a great  team that I can fit in. A team, that I can learn from. A team, that I can grow with. A team, that I can contribute to its developement and success... And ultimately, a team to have fun with while doing stuff we all love.</p>
                    <p>I'm hoping that this website would give you a solid understanding of my skills and convince you that what I lack in experience I make up for  with creativity, passion, and aptitude.</p>
